# Algorithms and Data Structures Visualizer

An interactive web application for visualizing algorithms and data structures.
The goal of this project is to make complex computer science concepts easier to
understand through animations, step-by-step execution, and clear visual
feedback.

## About the Project

This project was created as part of the **Developing Software Solutions** course
at the **University of Ljubljana, School of Economics and Business**. It serves as
a semester project assignment and a personal learning exercise.

I chose to build an **Algorithms and Data Structures Visualizer** to challenge
myself with modern front-end technologies and to deepen my understanding of
fundamental computer science concepts. Beyond fulfilling course requirements,
the application is designed as an educational tool for anyone who wants to learn
how algorithms and data structures work internally.

## Why This Project?

- To reinforce and refresh core computer science knowledge
- To practice building interactive and educational user interfaces
- To experiment with visualizing abstract logic in a clear and intuitive way
- To gain hands-on experience with modern front-end tooling
- To create a reusable learning resource for students and self-learners

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:nyanSpruk/algorithms-visualizer.git
  cd algorithms-visualizer
  ```

2. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  ```

3. Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

## Usage

- Select an algorithm or data structure from the navigation
- Adjust settings such as speed or input size
- Start the visualization to observe step-by-step execution
- Pause, resume, or reset the animation at any time
